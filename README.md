# 22-3-anagrams
Write a function that takes two strings and returns true if the first string is an anagram of the second (that is, you can get the first string from the second by rearranging the letters), and false otherwise. To achieve a good asymptotic solution, it is recommended to use std::map.
Anagram example: avadakedavra - kedavraavada
